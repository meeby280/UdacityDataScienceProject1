## Introduction

Wondering how to tell if you're getting a great deal on your Airbnb rental? You might think that listings from Superhosts often come with much higher price tags. But is the extra cost really worth it? Do Superhosts actually offer a better experience? Let's dive into some data from the Boston, Massachusetts and Seattle, Washington markets in 2017 to see what factors play a role in determining rental prices.

## Average Price Per Review and Superhost

One might assume that renting from a Superhost would significantly increase the cost. However, the average price for having a Superhost is only about $3 more.

If a listing has better reviews, it might have higher prices as well. Surprisingly, Boston and Seattle have opposite trends when it comes to this. Boston host do tend to charge more if the reviews are better. But Boston Superhosts actually tend to charge more the lower their review scores are. Conversely, Seattle regular host might try to charge more even with lower review scores. Seattle Superhosts tend to charge less the lower their review scores are.

## Superhost status by response rate and review grade

So, are Superhosts worth the extra money? It seems they might be, especially if they have good reviews, depending on the city. A quick response from the host can enhance your stay and lead to better reviews. When looking at review scores and response rates, it's clear that Superhosts often score higher in both areas.

## What other things seems to be best to try and estimate what the price of your rental should be?

When deciding if a rental is worth its price, there are several key factors to consider. It's not just about the location; you also need to look at the type of room, how many people it can accommodate, the number of bedrooms, and the host's communication review score. These elements together can provide a clearer picture and help you estimate whether the price per night is reasonable.

This chart shows the number of neighborhoods that fall into each $50 price bracket. Most neighborhoods tend to stay under $150 per night, while Boston neighborhoods seem to vary in price, with a noticeable gap in the $150-200 range. It does make sense that neighborhoods might have better access to local shopping or entertainment, and therefore hosts would want to charge more.

This chart shows the average price per night for each room type. Renting an entire home or apartment obviously commands a higher price. Noticeably, in Boston you might only end up paying a little more for a private room than a shared room, but in Seattle you can definitely save more by renting a shared room.

The number of people accommodated by the listing also influences the price as expected. The price seems to increase linearly. Listings for more than 8 people were less common, so the average price varies a lot more. If you need room for more than 8 people, you will have a harder time gauging if your rental price is fair.

Another detail that is expected to influence the price is how many rooms with beds are available in the rental. But this again seems to increase linearly, although you might save a little bit of money by choosing a rental with 1 bedroom as opposed to no bedrooms.

Lastly, it seems that when the host is better at communicating with guests, they tend to charge a bit less than those that are only somewhat communicative. This is especially true for Seattle, where hosts with a review score of 6 are charging $50 more per night than someone with a score of 9 or 10. Although, as with any of the charts up above, most of the hosts have a higher score, so those with lower scores tend to skew the average prices more.

## Conclusion

There are many factors that can influence whether you will be getting a good experience for the price you are paying. As seen above, just because you are paying more for a rental, you will not always be getting a better experience. You might be able to get a great deal on your rental if you book a listing with good reviews, a Superhost, and a host with great communication.
